The research on Airbnb listings in New York City utilized various data analysis techniques, including regressions and text analysis, to identify key factors influencing booking rates. Factors such as availability, review scores rating, price, value, property type, and cleanliness were found to significantly impact booking rates. The study encountered challenges such as missing data and unexpected results, including the significance of variables like host_length and host_response_time on listing availability, which required careful handling and further investigation.

A study analyzing Airbnb online reviews in 16 U.S. cities revealed key factors influencing overall review scores, including cleanliness, location, host interaction, property condition, accuracy of listing, communication, value for money, and neighborhood proximity to attractions. Utilizing big data analysis and Leximancer 4.0, the study identified correlations between these factors and review scores. However, limitations such as the exploratory nature of the study, limited data from specific regions, and potential subjective biases in the analysis tools were acknowledged. Criticisms included the tool's inability to capture tone and the need for further comprehensive analysis incorporating demographic factors and additional variables. Despite these challenges, the research provided valuable insights into Airbnb user experiences, suggesting avenues for future research to enhance understanding in the sharing economy.A study analyzing Airbnb online reviews in 16 U.S. cities revealed key factors influencing overall review scores, including cleanliness, location, host interaction, property condition, accuracy of listing, communication, value for money, and neighborhood proximity to attractions.
